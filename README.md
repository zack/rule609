- **Else, if witness was juvenile at time of crime and witness is defendant in a criminal trial:**
  - Automatically exclude. No balancing test applies.,
- **Else, if witness was juvenile at time of crime:**
  - Admit in a criminal case IF admission would be admissible against and adult AND the evidence is necessary to fairly determine the guilt or innocence,
- **Else, if crime was misdemeanor (and sentencing was 1 year or less) and the crime was not dishonest:**
  - Automatically exclude. No balancing test applies.
- **Else, if conviction & release were both >10 years ago:**
  - Admit if probative value substantially outweighs prejudicial effect and proponent gives adverse party reasonable written notice.
- **Else, if crime was dishonest:**
  - Automatically admit. No balancing test - not even Rule 403 - applies.
- **Else, if crime was a misdemeanor (and sentencing was 1 year or less):**
  - Automatically exclude. No balancing test applies.
